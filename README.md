## Day 1 - Expanding Cards

* `flex` property shorthand for flex-frow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. Assigned to individual flex items.
* `:nth-of-type()` css property. Say there are 10 items with same class. And if we want to target a specific item, we can use this. 
* `transition: property name | duration | easing function | delay` - Different things we can do with it.
